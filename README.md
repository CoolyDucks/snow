# SNOW Language ❄️

Welcome to SNOW, a programming language designed from scratch to make coding simple, intuitive, and powerful. SNOW is built to solve the frustrations that developers face in traditional languages: confusing syntax, heavy reliance on external libraries, overcomplicated features, and hard-to-read structures. SNOW aims to be human-friendly and enterprise-ready at the same time.

# Philosophy 😏

Programming should be natural. SNOW’s design focuses on:

Readable syntax: Commands that make sense without learning cryptic keywords.

Minimal boilerplate: No unnecessary declarations or headers for simple tasks.

Unified runtime and IDE: Write, test, and execute your code in the same environment.

Balanced simplicity: Easy for beginners, powerful enough for experienced developers.


The core idea: your code should do what it says, without hidden complexity.

# Key Features 😉

1. Human-Readable Commands

SNOW uses intuitive commands like:

say("Hello World!")

say("…") prints messages directly.

No need for semicolons or extra syntax clutter.


2. Math Support

Perform calculations naturally:

math {
    globle.math(2+2)
    globle.math(5*6)
} end

Supports +, -, *, / operations.

Evaluate multiple expressions in one block.


3. Time & Date Handling

Work with global time easily:

time {
    globle.gmt("1.2.3")
    globle.time("GMT")
} end

Initialize GMT version.

Access current time zones.

Useful for enterprise and server applications.


4. File Execution

Run SNOW scripts directly inside the IDE:

snow path/to/file.snow

No compilation steps needed.

Ideal for rapid development and testing.


5. Unified IDE + Runtime

SNOW comes with an integrated environment:

Prompt-based interface for writing code.

Immediate feedback for each command.

Simplifies the development workflow.


6. Extensibility

Designed for developers to extend:

Add new blocks or commands easily.

Integrate with other tools and scripts.

Enterprise-ready for internal tools, data processing, and games.


7. Minimal Dependencies

SNOW avoids heavy libraries.

Works on Linux, Termux, and Unix-like systems.

Lightweight and portable.

# Example Script 😌

say("Hello Snow!")

math {
    globle.math(2+2)
    globle.math(5*6)
} end

time {
    globle.gmt("1.2.3")
    globle.time("GMT")
    say("Welcome to GMT time")
} end

say("Goodbye Snow!")

Prints messages, evaluates math expressions, and shows time.

Demonstrates the human-readable structure of SNOW.

# Why SNOW? 🪷

No confusion: Forget cryptic keywords or verbose syntax.

Fast prototyping: Immediate execution in IDE.

Clean and elegant: Ideal for personal projects, enterprise tools, or education.

Extensible: Developers can build more complex functionality gradually.


SNOW is designed for developers who want clarity, speed, and simplicity without sacrificing power.
